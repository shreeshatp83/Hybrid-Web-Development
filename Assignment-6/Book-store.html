                    The main objective of the project is to create an online book store that allows users to
                    search and purchase a book based on title, author and subject. The selected books are
                    displayed in a tabular format and the user can order their books online through credit card
                    payment. The Administrator will have additional functionalities when compared to the
                    common user.
